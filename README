================================================================================
CSS Color Table
v0.1.2 (2013.08.09)

Jason Sims <jason@symmetriq.net>
================================================================================

A PHP script that parses a CSS file, collects all of the color values, converts
them to other color representations and displays them all in a sortable table.

This should be placed in the same directory as the CSS file. By default, it
looks for a file called 'style.css'. You can edit this at the top of the script.

Currently this only looks for color values in hex format, either in full or
using shorthand notation (e.g. #376, which expands to #337766).
